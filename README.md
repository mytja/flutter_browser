# Notice
This works great for simple pages, such as following, even though it can render most of the pages, such as Google (not pretty).
- https://html.duckduckgo.com/lite
- https://mytja.github.io/html5-css3-test-page

It isn't intended for serious use. It's just an experiment (proof of concept and a personal project) :wink:.

Browser supports only basic CSS and HTML.

Excuse me for the bad code.

# Platform support
Only Linux is supported. Windows & MacOS aren't yet supported (and probably never will be).

# License
GuineaHTML (everything in that subfolder, including libguineahtml & guinea_html Dart FFI interface) is licensed under the MIT License, meanwhile everything else (the Flutter application & mapper) is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license.
